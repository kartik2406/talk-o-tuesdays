## GQL all the things by Sara Vieira @ React Native EU 2018

### What is the talk about?

This talk explains how we can use graphql to manage state. All this is possible thanks to apollo-link-state.

### What will you learn?

- State management using GQL
- A bit about reacts compisibilty.
- Querying, mutating react state

### Summary

- You can use GQL to store at client side using apollo-link-state package.
- How does apollo know when to fetch from cache? It does with the help of @cache directive.
- When apollo encounters @cache it knows that it has to fetch the items from the client and not the server.
- Whats the advantage you might ask? Well you don't have to learn something new for state management, you can reuse your Graphql knowledge.
